Continues [[Power Factor]]
Supplemented by [[Working out a Transformer Problem]]

- ## The Ideal Transformer
	- Scale the voltage level
	- Isolation
	- Voltage across input and output coils is related to the ratio of the number of turns in each coil
		- $$V_{1}N_{2}=V_{2}N_{1}$$
			- $$\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}$$
		- If the signs of the input and output voltage are the same orientation, the ratio is positive
	- Since there can be no power loss, current has the opposite relation
		- $$\frac{I_{1}}{I_{2}}=\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}$$
