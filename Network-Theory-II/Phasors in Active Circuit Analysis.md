Continues [[RC LC Circuit Review]]
Continues [[Complex Phasors]]

- When considering a circuit with a sinusoidal input voltage
	- Capacitors and Inductors can be represented as resistors with an equivalent impedance
		- $$Z_{C} = \frac{-j}{\omega C}$$
		- $$Z_{L} = j\omega L$$
	- The circuit can now be looked at as a simple linear circuit and analyzed with Ohm's and Kirchoff's laws
