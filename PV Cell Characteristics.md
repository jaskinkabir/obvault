Continues [[PhotoVoltaic System Architecture]]
Uses [[MOS IV Characteristics]]

	- PV Cells act as a voltage controlled current source
	- $I_{mp}=$ Maximum Power Current
	- $V_{mp}=$Maximum Power Voltage
- The IV-Curves will change as a function of irradiance and temperature
	- **Irradiance:**  A measurement of the power outputted by the sun per unit area
		- W/m^2
	- It's challenging to monitor these conditions and extract the maximum power available
		- It is not economical to constantly monitor sensors to feed the PV system
		- The system must not rely on sensors to extract max power
- Example design problem

	- Can either use 72 or 60 cell configuration
		- 60 cells would be easier to fit in the 30k sqft area
		- 60 cell 295W panels would be better
			- After quick excel calculation, the max # of modules is 1661
