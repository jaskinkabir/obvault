Continues [[CMOS Signal Strength]]
Continued by [[Clock Skew and Path Constraints]]
- ## Transmission Gates
	- Pass a signal based on Enable signal
		- Uses only 2 transistors
	- ![[Pasted image 20240207103221.png]]
		- $EN$ signal will turn on the nmos, which will pass a 0 from $A$ to $B$
		- $\overline{EN}$ signal turns on PMOS, which passes 1 from $A$ to $B$
		- Notice that there is no direct path from B to $Vdd$ or $GND$
			- Signal will degrade over consecutive gates time
			- This is called **Nonrestoring**
- ## Tristate Buffer
	- Produces $Z$ or high impedance/floating when not enabled
		- There is no path to either $V_{dd}$ or GND
	- $X$ is produced when the output is driven to both GND and $V_{dd}$
		- Should never happen
	- ### Restoring Buffer
		- Uses more gates but will produce strong output
		- Basic version
			- ![[Pasted image 20240207102718.png]]
				- Requires inverted enable and inverts Y out
		- Realistic version

- ## Transmission Gate/Nonrestoring MUX
	- ![[Pasted image 20240207103616.png]]
	- Uses only 4 transistors
- ## Inverting MUX
	- ![[Pasted image 20240207103742.png]]
	- Uses compound AOI22
	- Adds inverter on the output
- ## D-Latch
	- ![[Pasted image 20240207103951.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240207104002.png]]
- ## D Flip-Flop
	- Built from master and slave D-Latches
	- How is edge sensitivity achieved?
		- ![[Pasted image 20240207104346.png]]
		- Similar to locks in Panama Canal
		- When clk is low, master latch is sensitive to D
		- When clk rises, master latch is no longer sensitive to D, but slave allows QM to move to Q
		- QM cannot be updated except for the rising edge 
	- ### Setup and hold time
		- ![[Pasted image 20240207104950.png]]
		- During the rising edge of the clock signal, there is a time when both latches are partially on
			- Slave on,
			-  master off
		- This means there is a time when Q is sensitive to D, which should never happen
		- This creates the necessity for designated setup and hold times during which D must be stable
			- Setup is time before rising edge
			- Hold is after
