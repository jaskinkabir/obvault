# Training Dataset
- If the data is labeled, it contains data and **Ground Truths** (correct answers)
- Machine learning's goal is not to learn ground truths
	- It's to generalize and discover patterns during training that can be used to accurately predict the outputs for unseen data

# Regression and Classification
- Machine learning functions maps an input data point to an output data point.
-  Depending on whether the outputs have a discrete range of valid points or exist in a continuous space, the problem can be classified in one of two ways
	- Regression works in a continuous space of infinite outputs
	- Classification has a set of discrete outputs
- In most cases, an ML problem on a single data set can be modeled as a regression or a classification problem
## Types of Regression Models
- Simple: one explanatory variable
- Multiple: several explanatory variables
- Linear/Non-Linear
