Continues [[The Decibel Scale]]
- ## The standard form of $\Large H(\omega)$
	- $$\large H(w)=M(\omega)e^{ j\phi(\omega) }=A_{1}(\omega)A_{2}(\omega)\dots A_{n}(\omega)$$
		- $Re\{ A_{i} \}=1\text{,  coefficient of w is one of 2 reciporicals: } \frac{1}{\omega_{z}} \text{ or } \frac{1}{\omega_{p}}$
	- Components with their imaginary parts in the numerator are $\omega_{z}$ zeros
		- $\omega_{p}$ poles in the denominator
	- A pole is an input value that causes the function to approach infinity
		- A zero causes the function to become 0
	- ### Real Zeros/Poles
		- Put the factor in the form $\omega_{z}\left(\frac{1}{\omega_{z}}s+1 \right)$
		- On the Bode Plot scale, this shows up as a line with slope 20 that starts at $\omega=\omega_{z}$
			- Magnitude: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{ \frac{\omega^2}{\omega_{z}^2} +1}}$
				- At $\omega_{z}$, the function takes the value 1. 20log(1) is zero
				- Before then, the omega term is very small, so we assume it is also zero
				- Afterwards, an increase in omega by a factor of 10 causes an increase in the db form of 20
		- Pole is the same but negative slope
		- $20(x-X(\omega_{z}))$, 0 before wz
		- $-20(x-X(\omega _{p}))$, 0 before wp
	- ### Quadratic Poles With Complex Conjugate Roots
		- The roots will be complex conjugates, so their break frequencies will be the same
			- The location, or 'activation point' is the same
		- Their slopes will be added together to be 40
		- If the quadratic pole is put in the form $s^2+bs+c$
			- The activation point is at $\omega_{b}=\sqrt{ c }$
		- $40(x-X(c))$ for zeroes
		- $-40(x-X(c))$ for poles
	- ## The X Scale
		- Depending on where the first 'activation point' is, you must define a value for omega to be 0 on the graph. Call this $\omega_{0}$
		- You can then define the x axis in terms of $$X(\omega)=\log(\omega)-\log(\omega_{0})$$
		- Then each factor of the standard form transfer function can be written in terms of X
