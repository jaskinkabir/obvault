Continues [[Digital Filter Design]]

- ## Impulse Invariance
	- This method perfectly preserves the impulse response of the system at the sample points, however the step response is warped due to aliasing.
		- For a system that only has to respond to an impulse train, this is desirable
		- However, for systems that respond to steps, the ZOH or step invariance method is preferred
	- ### Considerations For The Continuous Frequency Response
		- Cannot have a region with a value of zero
			- Sinc functions can exist because they are zero crossing
			- But they cannot stay at zero
		- **Any realizable filter must have an infinitely long tail**
			- Must have some degree of aliasing

	- ### Frequency Domain Method
		- Sample the selected continuous time impulse response with design sample period $T_{d}$
			- $h[n]=T_{d}h_{c}(nT_{d})$
				- This is the time domain method lol that's it
			- This period has no effect on the design
		- Since $h[n]$ is a sampled $h_{c}(t)$, the Fourier transform of $h[n]$ in terms of the Fourier Transform of $h_{c}(t)$ is as follows:
			- $$H(e^{j\omega})=\frac{1}{T} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}H_{c}\left( j \frac{\omega}{T_{d}} + j \frac{2\pi}{T_{d}}k \right)$$
				- $$=\frac{1}{T} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}H_{c}\left( j \frac{\omega+2\pi k}{T_{d}} \right)$$
				- This comes from the convolution of $H_{c}(\omega)$ with an impulse train
		- If the filter is bandlimited such that 
			- $H_{c}(j\Omega)=0,\,|\Omega|\geq \pi/T_{d}$
				- $\omega \geq \pi$, from $\omega=\Omega T$
				- $H_{c}$ is zero for any $\omega$ greater than pi
		- Then
			- $$H(e^{j\omega})=H_{c}\left( j \frac{\omega}{T_{d}} \right), \, |\omega|\leq \pi$$
				- Because any frequency outside the passband results in a response of 0. 
				- This means that, so long as $\omega \geq \pi$, the term multiplied by $k$ will bring the frequency above the bandlimit and result in a response of  0
	- ### Using The Frequency Domain Method
		- To find the right $H(e^{j\omega})$, we convert the specifications on the discrete time frequency response to continuous time by relating $\Omega=\frac{\omega}{T_{d}}$
			- Note that varying $T_{d}$ does not alter the aliasing that occurs from trying to sample an infinite continuous impulse response.
		- Then, a suitable continuous frequency response curve (CT) is plotted, and this is transformed to the Z transform and then to the DTFT
		- Consider a system whose Laplace response is expressed in terms of a partial fraction expansion such that
			- $$H_{c}(s)= \sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{A_{k}}{s-s_{k}}$$
			- Performing an inverse Laplace Transform yields
				- $h_{c}(t)=u(t)\sum_{k=1}^{N}A_{k}e^{s_{k}t}$
			- The impulse response of the discrete-time filter obtained by sampling $T_{d}h_{c}(t)$ is
				- $$h[n]=T_{d}h_{c}(nT_{d})=u[n]T_{d}\sum_{k=1}^{N}A_{k}e^{(s_{k}T_{d})^{n}}$$
			- The Z-Transform is then
				- $$H(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{T_{d}A_{k}}{1-z^{-1}e^{s_{k}T_{d}}}$$
				- Since the sampled response must be right sided, the ROC of the Z-Transform is as follows
					- $|z| >$ the outermost pole
						- $|z| > e^{s_{N}T_{d}}$
	- ### Impulse Invariance Stability
		- Time and frequency domain methods are equivalent
		- **Stable poles in $H_{c}(s)$ assure stable poles for $H(z)$**
			- A stable analog (continuous) filter ensures a stable digital filter
			- $\frac{1}{\left(\frac{s}{\Omega _c}-e^{\frac{3\pi \:i}{4}}\right)\left(\frac{s}{\Omega _c}-e^{-i\:\frac{3\pi }{4}}\right)}$
	- ### 2nd Order Butterworth Example
		- $$H_{c}(s)=\frac{1}{\left( \frac{s}{\Omega_{c}}e^{\frac{j_{3}\pi}{4}} \right)\left( \frac{s}{\Omega_{c}}e^{-j_{3}\pi/4} \right)}$$
- Consider $H(s)=\frac{1}{s+1}$
	- The z-transform of the equivalent discrete-time filter can be found with the following process
		- Find the impulse response with the inverse Laplace transform
			- $h(t)=e^{-t}$
		- Sample the impulse response
			- $h_{d}[n]=e^{-nT}$
		- Take the Z-Transform of this impulse response
			- $H_{d}(z)=\frac{z}{z-e^{-T}}$
	- Applying this method changes the discrete impulse response by a constant gain factor equal to the inverse of the sampling period
	- This is because the Z-Transform function involves a multiplication by $\frac{1}{T_{s}}$
	- So $h_{d}[n]=T_{s}h_{c}(nT)$
