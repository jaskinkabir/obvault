1) (8 points) Match the following functions to one of the five TCP/IP layers: 
	1) a) Making sure that the transmitted data frames do not overflow at the receiverâ€™s buffer: **Transport**
	2) b) Performing data compression: **Application**\
	3) c) Specifying the number of pins in an RS-232 connector: **Physical**
	4) d) End-to-end flow control: **Transport**
	5) e) Encoding a bit into appropriate signals such as voltage levels for transmission : **Physical**
	6) f) Recovering from errors caused by a noisy channel: **Data Link**
	7) g) Determining the route for forwarding packets to the final destination : **Network**
	8) h) Detecting errors :**Data Link**
2)  (8 points) A TCP segment consisting of 1000 bits of data and 150 bits of header is sent to the IP layer, which appends another 150 bits of header. This is then transmitted through three networks, each of which uses a 24-bit packet header. The destination network has a maximum packet size of 600 bits. How many bits, including headers, are delivered to the network layer protocol at the destination
	1) TCP layer sends 1150 bit segment to IP layer
	2) IP Layer sends 1300 bit packet to network layer
	4) Network layer can only send $600-24=576$ bits of data per frame
		1) $\frac{1300}{576}=$ 3 frames must be sent
		2) 2 frames will be a full 600 bits
		3) The final frame will contain 24 bits plus the remaining $1300-576*2$ bits from the original IP packet, which will be a total of $148+24=172$ bits
		4) Total data sent is $600+600+172$ bits
	5) $1372$ **TOTAL BITS**
3)  (4 points) In protocol layer structure, one protocol data unit (PDU) in layer N is encapsulated in a PDU at layer (N-1) and a (N-1)-header is added. It is also possible to break one N-level PDU into multiple (N-1)-level PDUs (segmentation) or to group multiple N-level PDUs into one (N-1)-level PDU (blocking).
	1) a) In the case of segmentation, is it necessary that each (N-1)-level segment contain a copy of the N-level header? Please explain your answer
		1) The $N$ level header generated by the source entity includes the address of its $N$ layer peer entity that it is sending data to. If this $N$ layer PDU is then segmented by the $N-1$ entity at the source, then each segment must include the $N$ level header. Otherwise, the $N-1$ layer entity at the destination would not know which $N$ layer entity to transfer its received data to. If each individual segment contains this address information, then the $N$ layer entity at the destination will receive the full PDU sent by the source. This is why it is necessary that each $N-1$ level segment contains a copy of the $N$ level header
	2) b) In the case of blocking, is it necessary that each N-level PDU retain its own header, or can the data be consolidated into a single N-level PDU with a single N-level header? Please explain your answer
		1) If the $N$ level PDUs that are being blocked together by the $N-1$ entity are all meant for different $N$ level peer entities at the source, then these destination entities would be specified in the destination address field of the $N$ layer PDU. Thus, to ensure that each $N$ level PDU in the $N-1$ layer block reaches its appropriate $N$ level destination entity, each individual $N$ level PDU must be included alongside its $N$ layer header when placed into the $N-1$ layer blocked PDU. The data cannot be consolidated into a single N-level PDU with just one N-level header
			1) Even if every N-Level PDU is addressed to the same N-level destination entity, the N layer entity might try to implement some sort of error detection or receipt confirmation that is stored in the headers. By consolidating all the data into one single header, this functionality cannot be implemented.
			2) Furthermore, modifying the N-Layer headers at the N-1 layer would break the standardization principle of the protocol architecture. Each layer should only concern itself with transmitting the full length of data it has received from its above entity to the appropriate peer entity. Nothing more and nothing less.
