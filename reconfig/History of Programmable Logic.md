# PAL
- Programmable array of logic
- Several and and or gates whose connections can be burned in by burning through fuses in between the inputs and the gates
- Can add D-flip flops to the PAL
	- A MUX is added to disable the flip flop
- Add switch boxes in between several PLAs
- This can allow for arbitrary routing between the blocks to create more complex systems
# LUTs and Logic Cells
- An $n-$input LUT has $2^{n}$ SRAM cells connected to a $2^{n}\to1$ mux
- Can generate any $n-$input function
	- Also called a function generator
- A logic cell contains a LUT and a flip flop
# Logic Blocks
- A logic block combines several logic cells
- With special purpose circuitry like add/sub carry chains
- Routing circuitry
# Special Purpose FN Blocks
- Block RAM
- DSP Blocks
- Processors
- Digital Clock Manager
- Gigabit Transceivers

# Xilinx HDL to Bitstream Process
## Synthesis
- Converts HDL into a netlist
### xst
- From
	- HDL source .vhd/.v
	- Project file (List of source) .prj
	- Synthesis script .xst
- Generates
	- Xilinx Netlist (.ngc)
	- Synthesis report (.srp)
		- Synthesis report might show more latches than required
		- This points to inferred latches
## Implementation
### NGD Build
- Combines standard netlist/macros and user constraints with the synthesized netlist into one overall **database** netlist
- From
	- User constraints .ucf
	- Standard netlists .edif 
		- A netlist synthesized by an external synthesis program
		- These are optional
	- Xilinx netlist .ngc
		- From Xilinx Synthesis
	- Relatively placed (hard) macros .nmc
		- pre-routed structures of commonly used components
- Generates
	- Xilinx Database netlist .ngd
	- Build report .bld
### Map
- Associates and groups the logic from the netlist to chip primitives like LUTs or Mults
- From
	- Xilinx Database netlist  .ngd
- Generates
	- Native circuit description .ncd
### Place and Route (par)
- Assigns each primitive generated by the mapping step to a real primitive available on the chip and then routes the connections
- Most efficient algorithm was once to randomly place components and try to route until a placement configuration is possible to route
- From ncd
- Generates Mapped NCD \_map.ngd 
## Bistream Generation
- Bitgen
	- From 
		- Mapped NCD \_map.ngd
	- Generates 
		- Bitstream to configure and initialize FPGA
- Along with a header, each column of the 2-D SRAM array is written out sequentially to a bitstream file
## Xilinx Synthesis Process
- Takes hdl, project file and syntehsis script
- Outputs xilinx netlist and synthesis report

- $f(w,\,x,\,y,\,z)=w+x+yz$
