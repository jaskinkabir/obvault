- ## DSB-SC Modulation
	- Double-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation
	- Shift a baseband signal $m[n]$ to high frequency
	- 
	- $f_{dsb-sc}[n]=m[n]\cos(\omega_{c}n)$ where $F\{m[n]\}=M(\omega)$
	- $F\{f_{dsb-sc}[n]\}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}m[n]\cos[\omega_{c}n]e^{-j\omega n}$
	- $$m[n]\cos[\omega_{c}n]\iff \frac{1}{2}[M(\omega-\omega_{c})+M(\omega+\omega_{c})]$$

		- ![[Pasted image 20240326102720.png]]
		- Receiver's lowpass should have the same bandwidth as the original $m[n]$
	- ### Problems with DSB-SC
		- Signal loses power/voltage across distance, so amplification must be performed by receiver
		- How can phase shift be determined by the receiver? How can the transmitter and receiver be synchronized?
## Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
- ## Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
	- QAM is most commonly used
	- Takes advantage of orthogonality of sin and cos
	- Results in "double-use" of frequency channel
	- $$f_{qam}[n]=m_{c}[n]\cos[\omega_{c}n]+m_{s}[n]\sin[\omega_{c}n]$$

	- ### Receiver Analysis
		- ![[Pasted image 20240326103524.png]]
		- Because $\pm\cos$ and $\pm \sin$ are 90 degrees apart, independent data streams can be encoded in each channel without affecting the other
		- ![[Pasted image 20240326104442.png]]
			- Note that both trig identities of $\sin^{2}$ and $\cos^{2}$ result in a component of 1
			- Meaning that the resulting sum of products at the output of the receiver's multiplier contains $0.5m_{c}[n]+\dots$ or $0.5m_{s}[n]+\dots$ for the sine channel
			- low-pass filter can recover these original signals
	- ## Constellations
		- Multiple bits can be transmitted per unit of time (the terminology in data comm is symbol)
		- This is done by plotting $m_{c}[n]$ and $m_{s}[n]$ against each other. A set of points on this graph (typically a power of two in number) are chosen to each represent a different set of bits
		- 16-QAM
			- ![[Pasted image 20240403213702.png]]
			- If the receiver sees an amplitude of 1 on $m_{c}[n]$ and an amplitude of 3 on $m_{s}[n]$, then the value `1100` was transmitted. (12d)
			- Thus, the total number of bits per symbol this method can transmit is 4
		- An $N$-point QAM system can transmit $\log_{2}N$ bits per sample.
		- If there is noise, the receiver will interpret the data to represent the closest point on the constellation chart (as in Euclidean distance)
- ## Downsampling
	- ### Definition
		- Done generally by an integer factor and is defined as 
			- $y[n]=x[kn]$
			- If k=4, $y[n]=x[4n]$, every 4th sample is retained rest discarded
		- This process decreases the sample rate by a factor of k, which saves computation time and power, but loses data
	- ### Effect on Spectrum
		- $$Y(\omega)=\frac{1}{k} \sum_{\alpha=0}^{k-1}X\left( \frac{\omega}{k} - \frac{2\pi\alpha}{k} \right)$$
		- Now that the sampling rate has been decreased, $Y(\omega)=2\pi$ now corresponds to $\frac{1}{k}$ times the original sample frequency in Hz, so the continuous time sampled spectrum $Y_{s}(\Omega)$ aliases at 1/4 the original rate
		- $Y_{s}(\Omega)$ has $\frac{1}{k}$ the amplitude of $X_{s}(\Omega)$
		- Since the sample rate is decreased, the bandwidth increases. Aliasing is now easier to achieve
