4. The profile screen should look like this![[Pasted image 20250616114143.png]]
	1. The first time your camper signs into Minecraft on campus, they will need a sign in code that will be sent to either the email address or the phone number that you used to make the account. If this email address/phone number is only accessible by you, you will need to be available in the morning when they sign in for the first time. 
	2. For at least this week, make sure not to restrict your camper's account from playing on multiplayer servers. We will be playing together on a multiplayer server for this camp
5. Next, download the Minecraft installer from https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download and install the application
6. Login to the Minecraft application and attempt to play minecraft through the launcher. It will ask you to choose a username
7. Once you have set a Minecraft username, move on to installing Modrinth. You don't have to wait for Minecraft to be downloaded/installed through this launcher, and you can close it
# Enabling Multiplayer
- If the Microsoft account you used to buy Minecraft has its age set below 16, multiplayer will be disabled for the account
- Follow this guide to fix this, so your camper can play on the Camp server https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/parental-controls
