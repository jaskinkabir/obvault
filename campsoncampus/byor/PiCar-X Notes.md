# Assembly
- Small black pieces that will be lost to the shadow realm if dropped, only a few extras
- Be extremely careful with the ribbon cable
- Do not overtighten screws, especially onto the pi
- Place black pieces onto the white foam for contrast
- When placing the car upside down after installing the camera, make sure to place the foam beneath the hat so there is no pressure on the camera servo
- Ensure shaft of steering servo is at the center of the robot
	- This means steering servo wires go the opposite direction of the camera servo wires
- Should be **4** extra M2.5x18+6 standoffs
- M2.5x18 standoffs are unused (6 left over)
## Buy Extras Of:
- Ribbon Cables?
