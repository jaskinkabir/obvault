Using [[DIscrete Structure Notations]]
- ## Experiment
	- Any activity or process whose outcome is subject to uncertainty
- ## Sample Space
	- The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
	- Denoted by $\mathcal{S}$
	- Ex: Tossing a coin 2 times 
		- $\mathcal{S}=\{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$
	- ### Event
		- Any collection (subset) of outcomes contained in the sample space $\mathcal{S}$
			- An event is simple if it consists of exactly one outcome and compound otherwise
		- Denoted $E_{n}$
		- Ex: At least one heads
			- $E_{1}=\{ HH,HT, TH \}$ 
		- Ex: Only one Head
			- $E_{2}=\{HT,TH\}$
		- ### Events can be described with logical set notation
			- $E_{1}\cap E_{2}=\{ HT,TH \}$
				- Intersection
			- $E_{1}\cup E_{2}=\{ HH,HT,TH \}$
				- Union
			- $E_{1}^C=\{ TT \}$
				- Complement
			- $\emptyset$ = Null event
				- $\emptyset^C=\mathcal{S}$
