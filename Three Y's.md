# Three Y's of Logic Systems
Related to [[VHDL]]
- ## Hierarchy
	- Computer contains circuits containing chips containing transistors...
- ## Modularity
- Computers are made up of independent modules that work together
	- All modules have 3 properties:
		1. A well defined function (specification)
		2. A formal list of inputs and outputs
		3. A name
	- An <u>Interface</u> is:
		- Without specification
		- Used to interact with other modules
- ## Regularity
	- Many modules can be created each with the same behavior
	- Modules can be extended/repeated to extend their functionality
