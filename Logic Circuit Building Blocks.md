Continues [[Combinational Logic Representations]]
- # Multiplexing (Mux)
	- A multitude of inputs followed by $2^{\#\_of\_inputs}$ switching inputs 
		- The switching input forwards one of the inputs to the output

		- When there are many different select lines, they can be combined into one bus line
			- ![[Pasted image 20221014113159.png]]
			- Notation is tick mark and the number of select lines
- # Encoding
	- Takes a number of inputs and outputs their unique enumerated binary representation
	- ![[Pasted image 20221014113600.png]]
		- Outputs binary representation of the numbered buttons
- # Decoding
	- Takes some number of encoded inputs and outputs their corresponding output
