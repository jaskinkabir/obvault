- ## Basic Terms
	- **Data Communication:** Transmission of signals
	- **Networking:** Tech and architecture of comm networks to connect devices
- ## Communication Model:
	- Source->Transmitter->Transmission System->Receiver>Destination
	- ![[Pasted image 20240703184318.png]]
	- Source receives information $m$ and generates input data $g(t)$
	- Transmitter transforms $g(t)$ into transmitted signal $s(t)$ tand transmits across the transmission system
	- Receiver transforms $s(t)$ into received signal $r(t)$, then it outputs output data $g'(t)$
	- Destination transforms output data $g'(t)$ into output information $m'$
- ## Key Communication Tasks
	- ### Utilization
		- Ensure that each aspect of the communication system is fully and efficiently utilized
		- Ex: Multiplexing, congestion control
	- ### Interfacing
		- Devices on either side of the transmission system must be able to interface with it
	- ### Signal Generation
		- Transmitters must be able to generate signals that are capable of being propagated across the TX system
		- Signals must be able to be interpreted by the RX system
	- ### Synchronization
		- TX and RX systems must be synchronized. RX should be able to determine when a signal begins and ends
	- ### Exchange Management
		- If data is exchanged in both directions, it must be decided whether both devices can talk at the same time or in turns
		- The amount and format of data, etc must be decided
	- ### Error Detection/Correction
		- Errors and distortion should be able to be handled somehow
	- ### Flow Control
		- Ensure that the RX system is not overwhelmed by data being sent by the TX faster than the RX can process it
	- ### Recovery
		- The system must be able to resume operation in case of interruption
	- ### Addressing and Routing
		- When more than two devices share a TX/RX system, the source system must indicate the identity of the intended destination
		- The transmission system must assure that only the destination system receives the data
	- ### Security
		- Only the receiver can access the data
