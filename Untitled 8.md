# Breakup with Rster
- What does this entail? 
	- Obvious problem is that they will expect me to lie again and continue to see her
	- How can I even prove that I am truly broken up with her?
	- Enter a police state
- I do want to do this eventually
	- At least I think I do
		- I really enjoy my time with her
		- The sex/attraction problem is becoming less and less of an issue
	- The social anxiety problem seems pretty crucial
		- She can try to work on this
		- But just being in the store hurts her
	- I want to drink with her but she doesn't like it
- Hypocrisy and moral ramifications
	- I cannot let their values corrupt mine
	- 
# Stay with Rster blow up parental relationship
