Continues [[Signed Integers in Binary]]
- ## Adders
	- ### Half Adder
		- Adds 2 one bit integers
		- XOR handles the sum, AND handles carry
		- ![[Pasted image 20221130114138.png]]
	- ### Full Adder
		- Adds 2 one bit integers and the carry bit from the previous stage
		- ![[Pasted image 20221130114210.png]]
	- ### Ripple Carry
		- To add two integers of arbitrary length, the adding
- ## Subtractors
	- Invert the subtractand and add 1 to get the two's complement
		- Make the first adder stage a full adder and tie the carry input high
	- An Adder Subtractor combo can be made by having a 'sub' input that inverts one of the inputs and sets the first carry in high
	- Example implementation

- # ALU Arithmetic Logic Unit
	- Combination of adder/subtractor/comparator
	- ![[Pasted image 20221130112623.png|320]]
	- Two inputs and a select line
		- The select line will determine which operation is performed on the two inputs
	- The select line runs to a multiplexer that selects the output of the desired operation
	- Example implementation of 4 function ALU
