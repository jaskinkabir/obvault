# Transistors
Continues [[Combinational Logic Representations]]
Continued by [[CMOS Logic Design]]
- Have 3 terminals,
	- Source: Passes current to drain when gate is high
	- Gate: Determines state of transistor
	- Drain: Connected to source when gate is high
- MOS: Metal Oxide Silicon
	- pMOS: Normally closed
		- Passes good 0's
		- Connects source to GND
	- nMOS: Normally open
		- PAsses good 1's
		- Connects source to $V_{DD}$
