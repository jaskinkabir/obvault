- ## Logic Refresher/Introductions
	- ### Binary Representation of data
		- Counting and Math in binary is essentially the same as normal (decimal) numbers
	- ### Gates
		- AND OR NOT XOR
		- These four operations can be used to perform all mathematical operations
			- The foundation of modern computing
		- You can implement these systems in silicon, or in the advanced circuit simulation tool known as Minecraft
- ## Logical Building Blocks in Minecraft
	- ### Minecraft only has OR and NOT
		-   Two quick slides with truth tables
		-   All logic can be represented with these two operations
	- ### AND Gate
		-   Show the circuit
		- It's possible to explain how it works with the diagram/truth table
			-  Easier to explain in Minecraft
	- ### XOR
		- Show the circuit
		- Traditional $A\overline{B}+\overline{A}B$ method
		- Simplification with comparators
	- Quickly show examples of every gate in existence
- ## Computation
	- Quick overview of adders
		- Show 4 bit ripple carry
	- Subtraction
		- Two's Complement
	- Multiplication and division maybe? 
		- I don't even know how to fuckin do this yet lol
- ## Memory
	- If all logic exists so then does memory
	- ### S/R Latches
		- Show truth table, circuit, and explain in Minecraft
		- Show more complicated flip-flops
	- ### T-Flip Flops
		- Show that Minecraft has a much simpler shortcut for T-Flip Flops
	- ### Edge Detection and Triggering
		- Making flip-flops edge triggered
	- ### Repeater Locking
		- A memory method unique to Minecraft
			- Sometimes it's okay to take advantage of your tools
		- Show the Juul example
- ## Finale: Creating Complex Logical Systems: Tic-Tac-Toe
	- ### Planning Phase
		- How will cells be represented in binary?
		- Make sure not to think like a programmer
			- 00, 10, 11 vs 00, 01, and 10
		- How to store the cell data
			- S/R Latches are the best bet
		- Win/Tie Detection
			- Explain Behavior and circuit diagram
		- Game Control
			- Turn Flip flop
		- Draw shit out first man, it helps
	- ### Designing Phase
		- ### Display
			- Finding shortcuts in display design
			- Decoding
		- ### Memory Cell
			- Stacked S/R Latches controlling each other
			- Comparator blocking 
		- ### Win Detector
			- Show how the programmer's method would overcomplicate this
		- ### Tie Detection
			- Show that sometimes over planning will lead to oversight
			- Tie detection can just be tacked onto 3 win detectors
		- ### Turn Flip-Flop
			- Edge detection on the write signal
			- In real life a more complex system would need to be used 
	- ### Building Phase
		- #### Wiring and Practical Design
			-  Minecraft's biggest disadvantage is the interference between wires
			- Spacing out connections and preventing spaghetti
				- Show the previous design of win detection
			- ### COLOR CODING
				- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
				- Make sure you don't confuse yourself
		- #### Black Box Principle
			- Make sure modules don't interfere with each other
