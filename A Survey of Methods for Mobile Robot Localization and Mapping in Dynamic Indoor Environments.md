- ## SLAM Methods
	- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
	- ### Occupancy Grid Technique
		- Uses a static and dynamic map
		- Occupancy probability is defined for each cell of both maps, where the confidence that the cell is occupied is this occupancy probability.
		- Dynamic objects are free space in the static map, and static objects like walls are free in the dynamic
		- #### Object Detection
			- Set a high threshold (.85) to the occupancy probability of a region to detect a moving object
			- Objects are differentiated based on size
			- If there is a new sensor reading, it must be determined whether the cell is part of an existing object
				- If the neighboring cells in the dynamic map have objects, then the current cell must be part of that same object
				- Otherwise it is a new object
