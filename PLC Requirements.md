- Configurations
	- Error detection and lifting are the big options
	- 000, no error no lifting
		- 1 PWM For both or 0 motors
		- No error detection output
		- No pressure sensors
		- No pause indicator
			- Always making noise in all 3 states
	- 001 No error, lifting with linked motors
		- Same as above but with two stepper drivers 
	- 010 No error, lifting with independent motors
		- 2 PWM for both motors
		- Can add a pause indicator because of 3 added DC outputs
	- 011 Error, no lifting
		- Cheaper to get 2 PWM PLC
	- 100 Error, linked motors
	- 101 Error independent motors
	- Relay module?
