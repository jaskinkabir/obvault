# LANs (11 and 12)
- LAN Topology
	- Bus and star
	- **Characteristics of each topology**
- Protocol Architecture: IEEE 802 reference model

	- Spanning tree
- Layer 2 Switches
	- Differences with hub, bridge, router
- Ethernet: IEEE 802.3
	- 802.3 MAC
	- ALOHA, slotted ALOHA
	- For CSMA and binary exponential backoff, **Know how to calculate collision probability**
# IP and Routing
- Basic functions
- Encapsulation
- Fragmentation and reassembly
	- **Know how to do offset and more fields**
- Ordered Delivery: May arrive out of order
- Addressing
	- Level: network-level, port-level, device-level
	- Mode: unicast, multicast, broadcast
- Routing: 
	- Least-cost (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
	- Source routing
	- Route recording
- IPv4 Header:
	- Understand meaning of each field
