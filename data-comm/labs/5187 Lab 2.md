1. What is the IP address of the sending computer?
	1. **192.168.86.61**
2. What is the value in the time-to-live (TTL) field in this IPv4 datagram’s header?
	1. **1**
3. What is the value in the Protocol field in this IPv4 datagram’s header?
	1. **17 (UDP)**
4. How many bytes are in the IP header?
	1. **20**
5. How many bytes are in the payload of the IP datagram? Explain how you determined the number of payload bytes.
	1. Total length field is set to 56. 56-20=36; **Payload is 36 Bytes**
6. Has this IP datagram been fragmented? Explain how you determined whether the datagram has been fragmented.
	1. **The packet has a fragment offset of 0 and the more flag is not set, meaning the packet was not fragmented**
	2. **Also, Wireshark does not show any fragmentation information for the packet**

7. Which fields in the IP datagram always change from one datagram to the next within this series of UDP segments sent by the sending computer destined to 128.119.245.12, via traceroute? Why? (List ALL the fields that change)
	1. **Identification: Always incrementing to differentiate messages**
	2. **Header Checksum: Changes because header always changes**
8. Which fields in this sequence of IP datagrams (containing UDP segments) stay constant? Why? (List ALL the fields that stay constant)
	1. **IP source and dest addr: These don't change because we have filtered to find packets with these two values**
	2. **Protocol: Filtered to find only UDP**
	3. **IP version: Dest and src addrs are ipv4 addresses, and those have been filtered to stay the same**
	4. **Differentiated services: All packets in traceroute use same service** 
	5. **ECN: The source computer is not ECN Capable**
	6. **Header Length: Traceroute does not use IPv4 extensions**
	7. **Flags: While the packets may be fragmented, this is done on the IP layer, so no UDP packets would have any flags set**
9. Describe the pattern you see in the values in the Identification field of the IP datagrams being sent by the sending computer.
	1. **Every datagram displayed by this filter has a identification value equal to the previously sent datagram plus one. The datagram identification fields are incremented in chronological order.**
`ip.dst==192.168.86.61 and icmp`

10. What is the value in the Protocol field specified in the IP datagrams returned from the routers?
	1. **1 (ICMP)**
11. Are the values in the Identification fields (across the sequence of all of ICMP packets from all the routers) similar in behavior to your answer to Question 9 above?
	1. **The behavior of the identification fields is not similar. The values do not correspond to the chronological order in which the packets were received.**
	2. **However, packets from the same router do have sequential identification numbers with respect to time**
12. Are the values of the TTL fields similar, across all of ICMP packets from all the routers?
	1. **The TTL value is the same for all packets sent from the same router**

13. Find the first IP datagram containing the first part of the segment sent to 128.119.245.12 sent by the sending computer via the traceroute command to gaia.cs.umass.edu, after specifying the traceroute packet length to be 3000. (Hint: This is packet 179 in the ip-wireshark-trace1-1.pcapng trace file.). Has that segment been fragmented across more than one IP datagram?
	1. **Yes the segment has been fragmented**
14. What information in the IP header indicates that this datagram has been fragmented?
	1. **The more flag is set**
15. What information in the IP header for this packet indicates whether this is the first fragment?
	1. **More flag is set, fragment offset is 0**
16. How many bytes are there in this IP datagram (header plus payload)?
	1. **1500 Bytes**
17. Now inspect the datagram containing the second fragment of the fragmented UDP segment. What information in the IP header indicates that this is not the first datagram fragment?
	1. **More flag is set, fragment offset is not 0**
18. **What** fields change in the IP header between the first and second fragment? List ALL the fields that change in the IP header.
	1. **Fragment Offset and Checksum**
19. Now find the IP datagram containing the third fragment of the original UDP segment. What information in the IP header indicates that this is the last fragment of that segment?
	1. **More flag is not set, fragment offset is not 0**
