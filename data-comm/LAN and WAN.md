## WAN
- Spans a large geographical area
- Consists of a number of interconnected **switching nodes**: Internal or intermediate nodes (routers). 
- ### Routers:
	- Interconnect source/destination devices
	- Are not directly accessible by the TX or RX systems
	- Are not concerned with data content
	- Route data from node to node until they reach their destination through the **best or shortest path**
- ### Implementation technologies
	- #### Circuit Switching
		- Use a dedicated comm path between two stations through the nodes
		- A connected sequence of physical links
		- There is a logical channel dedicated on each link.
			- 
		- Data generated by the source is transmitted **as rapidly as possible**
		- Most common example is a landline telephone network
	- #### Packet Switching
		- It is not necessary to dedicate transmission paths through the network
		- Data is sent out in a sequence of chunks called packets
		- Packets are passed from node to node leading from s to d
		- Packets must be sent by the source system only as fast as the transmission network can route them to the destination
		- The crucial difference is that each path within the network can handle multiple different connections, whereas circuit switching dedicates each physical path to just two devices
		- Example is the internet
## LAN
- Cover a smaller area
	- Internal data rates are typically much higher than WANs
- ### Implementation:
	- #### Switched LAN
		- Uses physical ethernet switches to connect devices
	- #### Wireless LAN (WLAN)
		- Uses a router that receives and transmits EM signals wirelessly
