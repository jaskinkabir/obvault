The process of converting Analog data into a Digital signal is called Digitization
# Pulse Code Modulation:
PCM is based on the sampling theorem:
- This is just the Nyquist thing, sample at twice the bandwidth after a bandpass filter and get a perfect reconstruction 
But the samples you get from this technique are just analog samples, called **Pulse Amplitude Modulation** samples. To convert to digital, each sample must be assigned a binary code. 
- Each PAM value, or amplitude sample, maps to a different integer value that is then transmitted in a bitstream. This mapping is called quantization
By quantizing the signal, we have introduced **quantizing error/noise** 
SNR for quantizing noise can be expressed as $$SNR_{dB}=20\log2^{n}+1.76dB$$
This technique is represented by the following diagram:![[Pasted image 20240718002555.png]]

## Nonlinear Encoding
The technique is typically further refined by using nonlinear encoding. This means that quantization levels are not  equally spaced.
Equal spacing causes a problem where the mean absolute error for each sample is the same, regardless of signal level. This means that lower amplitude values are distorted more than higher amplitude values. By using more steps for low amplitude and fewer steps for high amplitude, a marked reduction in signal distortion is achieved. ![[Pasted image 20240718002747.png]]
- The greater resolution at the lower amplitudes makes the encoding of the weak signal much more accurate
- In contrast, the lower resolution at the higher amplitude has barely any effect on the strong signal's accuracy.
## Companding
By using uniform (linear) encoding but companding( Compressing-expanding) the analog signal, the same effect can be achieve. Companding is a process that compresses the intensity range of a signal by imparting more gain to weak signals than to strong signals. At the output, the reverse operation is performed. 
- Compacting happens on the input side, strong signals are compacted down relative to weak signals
- Expanding happens on the output side, those now weak signals are expanded to be strong again.

# Delta Modulation (DM)
One of the most popular alternatives to PCM is DM. With DM, the analog input is approximated by a staircase function that moves up or down by one quantization level $\delta$ at each sampling interval ($T_{s}$). The behavior of this staircase function is binary. At each sampling time, the function either moves up or down by a constant amount $\delta$. Thus the output of DM can be represented by a single bit for each sample. 
In essence, the bit stream is produced by approximating the derivative of the signal rather than its amplitude. A 1 is generated when the staircase goes up, 0 if down.

For transmission, at each sampling time the amplitude of the analog signal is compared to the most recent value of the staircase function. If the analog signal is greater, a 1 is generated and the staircase moves up by $\delta$. Otherwise, it generates a 0 and moves down. The receiver can then reconstruct the staircase function and then smooth it out with some integration process or lowpass filter.

### DM Errors
The Delta Modulation Scheme has two important parameters
- Step size $\delta$
- Sampling rate $T_{s}$
![[Pasted image 20240718004002.png]]
When the analog waveform is changing very slowly (slower than the staircase can deal with), there will be **quantizing noise** caused by the staircase moving up and down repeatedly. **Quantizing Noise Increases with $\delta$**
However, when the analog waveform changes faster than the staircase function can follow it, there is **Slope Overload Noise which Increases inversely with $\delta$**

Thus, a high frequency signal is better approximated by a large $\delta$. While a low frequency signal is better approximated by a low $\delta$

The accuracy can also be increased by increasing the sampling rate. However, this also increases the data rate of the output signal.

The principal advantage of DM is that it is easier to implement than PCM. In general, PCM exhibits better SNR characteristics at a given data rate. 

# Performance
Good voice reproduction via PCM can be achieved with 7-bit encoding which results in 128 quantization levels. Conservatively, voice signals occupy a bandwidth of 4kHz. Thus, samples should be taken at 8000 samples per second. This implies a data rate of $R=2LB=2*7*4000=56kbps$ for the PCM-encoded data.

Recall that the channel capacity in terms of bits per second C is given by $C=2B$ for 2 level binary signals like DM and PCM. In the case described above, the 56Kbps signal generated by the voice signal could require up to 28KHz of bandwidth to be effectively transmitted. 
Even more severe differences can be seen with higher bandwidth signals. For example, a common PCM scheme for color TV uses 10-bit codes and works out to 92Mbps for a 4.6MHz bandwidth signal. Even though the bandwidth required to transmit a signal using PCM is orders of magnitude greater than the input signal's bandwidth, ADC-based transmission techniques continue to grow in popularity. This is because:
- Repeaters are used instead of amplifiers, which eliminates accumulated noise
- Time Division Multiplexing rather than Frequency Division Multiplexing is used. There is no intermodulation noise with TDM.
- Digital signals can utilize more efficient digital switching techniques.

Furthermore, more efficient codes can be developed. For example, with video encoding, a lot of picture elements won't change from frame to frame. Thus, an encoding scheme is used that only transmits the changes in the picture, which allows the requirement for data rate to be reduced to about 15 Mbps rather than 92. For slowly changing scenes, this can even be reduced to 64Kbps or less for something like Zoom calls.
