- ## Transmission Impairments:
	- Analog signals experience degradation of signal quality
	- Digital signals experience bit errors
	- The most significant impairments are
		- ### Attenuation and attenuation distortion
			- Reduction in strength across a large distance causes the signal to become quieter than the natural noise floor
			- A signal must have a level higher than the noise to be received without error
			- **Attenuation is greater at higher frequencies**
				- This is known as attenuation distortion
				- If the input signal has some fourier transform, the receiver will see a signal with a very different fourier transform, as the higher frequencies experience greater attenuation
				- Amplifiers that amplify higher frequencies more than the lower ones can equalize attenuation across the spectrum
				- On telephone lines, this is solved through loading coils that change the electrical properties of the line
			- Use amplifiers and repeaters to solve this
		- ### Delay distortion
			- Occurs in transmission cables because the propagation velocity of different components of the signal varies with frequency
			- For a signal with a given BW, the velocity tends to be highest near the center frequency of the signal and to fall off toward the two edges of the band. 
			- Different components will reach the receiver at different times
			- This is especially problematic for digital signals. Consider a sequence of bits is being transmitted. Because of delay distortion, some of the signal components of 1 bit will spill over into other bit positions
				- This is called **Intersymbol Interference**
				- This is a major limitation to maximum bit rate over a transmission channel
		- ### Noise
			- Unwanted signals inserted between devices
			- #### Noise categories
				- ##### Thermal
					- Thermal agitation of electrons called white noise
					- Present in all electronic devices and media and is a function of temperature
					- It is independent of frequency, or at least assumed to be so
					- Noise power density $$N_{0}=kT$$, where k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temp in kelvins
						- $k=13.8 \frac{J}{K}$
						- $N_{0}$ is measured in $\frac{W}{Hz}$ or $J$
					- Thermal noise power: 
						- $N=N_{0}B$, where B is bandwidth in Hz and N is in watts
						- In decibel-watts: $$N=10\log(k)+10\log(T)+10\log(B)$$
				- ##### Intermodulation
					- When signals at different frequencies share the same medium, intermodulation noise may be experienced
					- The effect of this is that signals are produced at frequencies that are the sum or difference of the two original frequencies, or multiples of those frequencies.
					- Produced by nonlinearities in the TX, RX, or medium
				- ##### Crosstalk
					- Signal from one line is picked up by another
					- Typically the same magnitude as or less than thermal noise
				- ##### Impulse
					- Caused by external EMI
					- Short duration and high amplitude
					- This is the **Primary Source of Error For Digital Data**
