Implementation of [[CMOS Logic Design]]
Continued by [[Gate Layout]]
# This shit needs to be reorganized 

- ## Process Overview
	- CMOS Transistors are fabricated on a silicon wafer
	- Lithography progress similar to printing press
	- On each step, different materials are deposited or etched
	- Easiest to understand by viewing both top and bottom cross-section of wafer in a simplified manufacturing process
- ## idk
	- Typically use P substrate and deposit materials onto it

		- Side view
		- A contact is placed above the A polysilicon to apply a field to the input
	- ![[Pasted image 20240124110733.png]]
		- Top view
		- A mask is applied to the wafer to place the components into it
	- ![[Pasted image 20240124110632.png]]
		- The p substrate is at the top of this diagram
- ## Fabrication Steps
	- Start with blank wafer
	- Build inverter from bottom up
	- ### Forming N-Well
		- Coat wafer with protective dioxide ($SiO_{2}$)
		- Remove layer where n-well should be
		- Implant or diffuse n dopants into exposed wafer
		- Strip off $SiO_{2}$
		- How to implant into n-well?
			- Spin on photoresist
				- Light sensitive polymer
				- Softens where expose to light
			- Expose photoresist through n-well mask
			- Strip off exposed photoresist
				- The photoresist that is softened can be removed easily
			- How to get through $SiO_{2}$?
				- Etch oxide with hydroflouric acid (HF)
				- Only atttacks oxide where resist has been exposed
			- Use mixture of acids called piranha etch to remove photoresist
		- n-well is then formed using diffusion or ion implantation
			- Diffusion
				- Place wafer in furnace with arsenic (or any Group 5 ) gas
				- Heat until As atoms diffuse into exposed Si
			- Ion Implantation
				- Blast wafer with beam of As ions
				- Only enter exposed Si not past $SiO_{2}$
		- Strip off remaining oxide using HF
		- Back to bare wafer with n-well
	- ### Polysilicon
		- Deposit thin layer of gate oxide (6-7 atomic layers)
		- Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
		  
	- ### Metallization
		- Sputter aluminum over whole wafer
		- With a pattern to only place metal where contacts need to be connected
- ## Summary
	- Masks are created to expose only some parts of the wafer to light
	- Etch that part away
	- Implant certain materials into the substrate wafer depending on the purpose of the mask
- ## Layout
	- Chips are specified with aset of masks
	- Minum dimensions of masks determine transistor size, speed cost and power
	- Feature size $f=$ distance between source and drain
		- Determined by width of polysilicon
		- Express rules in terms of $\lambda=\frac{f}{2}$
			- eg $\lambda=0.3 \mu m$ in a $0.6\mu m$ process
