Matching regular expressions using FPGA hardware has been extensively studied, but much less attention has been shown to the problem of dynamically updating the matching pattern as new information becomes available during the problem-solving process. This gap is especially important in scenarios where incremental updates are crucial, such as malicious internet packet detection. Further insight into this problem can be found through the case study of automatically solving Wordle puzzles using FPGA hardware.

Wordle is a puzzle in which the player must guess a randomly chosen five-letter English word. Upon each incorrect guess, the player receives incremental information about the correct word, such as which letters are or are not in the correct word. This feedback allows the player to refine their guesses and find the solution.

In software implementations of automatic Wordle solving, the feedback is translated into a regular expression that filters the list of possible solutions.  However, this requires the regular expression to be rewritten and recompiled after each guess, which is computationally expensive and inefficient. 

In contrast, this problem could also be solved using a flexible state machine implemented on an FPGA. This would accelerate the puzzle-solving process and also shed light on the broader challenge of online regular expression matching. By solving the Wordle puzzle incrementally on FPGA, insights could be found about the optimization of pattern matching in dynamic and evolving contexts.
