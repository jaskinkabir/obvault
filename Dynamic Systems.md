Using [[Complex Phasors]]
- In any system with energy storage (dynamic systems) have 2 componens of the response
	- A response derived directly from its input
		- Steady state response
		- Driven response
	- A response that reflects the finite amount of time it takes for the energy to change from the initial to the final state
		- This is the homogenous/complementary/**Transient Response**
		- System response
- ## The solution Approach For DiffEQ
	- 1.  Solve the homogenous equation
		- Transient response
		- $y_{c}(t)$
	- 2. Solve the non homogenous equation
		- Find particular solution with undetermined coefficients
	- 3. Find total soluion
		- Use inital conditions
- ### Example:

- ## Damping of Solutions
	- For the characteristic equation $s^{2} + bs + c$
		- Solution will be in form $$Y_{c}(t) = C_{1}e^{s_{1}t} + C_{2}e^{s_{2}t}$$
		- If b=0. **Undamped**
			- $s_{1}= j*\sqrt{c}$
			- $s_{2}= -j*\sqrt{c}$
			- $$Y_{c}(t) = C_{1}e^{j\sqrt{c}} + C_{2}e^{-j\sqrt{c}}= 2|C_{1}|cos(\sqrt{c}t + \angle C_{1})$$
				- A constant amplitude sinusoidal function
				- No energy loss in the system
		- if $b^{2}-4c < 0$ **Underdamped**
			- Only imaginary solutions to characteristic equation
			- $$Y_{c}(t) = 2|C|e^{\sigma_{d}t} cos(\omega_{d}+ \angle C)$$
				- $\sigma_{d} = real(s_{1})$
				- $\omega_{d} = |imag(s_{1})|$
		- if $b^{2}-4c=0$ **Critically Damped**
			- Impossible in the real world
		- if $b^{2}-4c > 0$ **Overdamped**
	- The damping of the system is determined by $b^{2}-4c$
	- The b term is typically the lossy part of the system
