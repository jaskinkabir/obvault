- # Linear Discriminant
	- Create linear boundaries
	- Non-parametric and distribution free

- # K-Means
	- ![[Pasted image 20240411102633.png]]
- # K-Nearest Neighbor
	- Find k nearest neighbors. Assign vector to the majority class of the neighbors
	- ## Minimum-Distance
		- K=1
- # Unsupervised Classifiers
	- An unsupervised classifier would look at the data and classify it based on the clustering of points in feature space
	- Then any method could be used to assign a class to a vector
