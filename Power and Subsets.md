# Power Sets and Subsets
Using [[DIscrete Structure Notations]]
- A is a subset of B if every element of A is in B
	- $A \subseteq B$
	- A proper subset of A is a subset that is not equal to A
		- $A \subset B$
			- Improper notation
	- If A is a finite set, # of subsets of A $= 2^{|A|}$
		- B = {$C : C \subseteq A$} |B| = $2^{|A|}$
		- B is the **Power Set** of A
	- **Power Set** is the set of all subsets
		- Notation: $2^A$
