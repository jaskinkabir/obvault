- For two sets A and B, the relation R is any subset of AxB
	- Domain is the set of elements in the resulting lists that are from A
		- Range is from B
			- AKA Codomain
	- Image of element a from set A is the corresponding element of B that is linked with a in R
		- For R = {(1,2),(3,3),(4,2)}
			- image a = 2
- For sets A = {1,2,3}, B = {a,b,c,d}
	- IF ARB = {(1,a), (1,d). (2,b), (2,c), (3,a), (3,c)}

	- The matrix representation is a matrix where each possible combination of the elements present in the cross product is given a 1 or 0 based on whether or not it is present in the relation subset
