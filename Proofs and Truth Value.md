# Proofs And Truth Value:
- **Statement: (Proposition)**: A claim that is either true or false
	- Truth Values:
		- Unkown (conjecture) 
		- True (theorem)
			- To be true, a statement must hold **IN ALL CASES**
		- False ('mistake')
		- Doesn't make sense ('nonsense')
- **Theorem:** A statement that can be shown (proven) to be true
	- **To prove**: A statement is to use logic, in a very specific waym to explain why the statement is true
	- Types of Theorems
		- Result: A generic term
		- Fact: Generic, often a minor theroeem
		- Proposition: Another word of a theorem, typically an important one
		- Lemma: Used to prove another theorem
		- Corolarry: A result of another theorem
- **Tautology:** A formula which is always true for all possible inputs
	- $2x + 1 = (x+1)^{2}-x^{2}$
- ### Proposition Operations
	- For statement P => Q
		- Inversion: Same order, negate P and Q
			- $\lnot P => \lnot Q$
			- Does not say anything about truth of either statement
		- Contraposition: Reverse order, negate both statements
			- $\lnot Q => \lnot P$
			- Logically equivalent
			- Original statement is true iff contrapositivwe is true
		- Negation 
			- $\lnot(P => Q)$
			- Negate whole statement 
			- If negation is true, original is false and vice versa
