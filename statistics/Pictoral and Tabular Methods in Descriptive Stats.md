	- ![[Pasted image 20230111113517.png|320]]
		- The bars must be arranged in descending order for ease of analysis
	- Also useful for discrete quantitative data
- ## Relative Frequency Bar Graph
	- If the graph is describing data collected from $n$ individuals,
		- The relative frequency of each individual can be found as
			- $$\frac{\#\space of\space category}{n}$$

- ## Describing Continuous Quantitative Data
	- In the example of categorizing individuals based on age, categories can be established based on age **ranges**
		- Determine minimum and maximum value, then define equally spaced intervals and group individuals based on these new categories
	- Construct a **Histogram**
