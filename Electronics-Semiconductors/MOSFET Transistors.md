- ## Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor
	- ### Properties
		- $\large C_{ox}$: Oxide Capacitance
		- $\large k_{n}$: Transconductance
		- $W:$ Width of Channel
		- $L$: Length of Channel
		- $\mu_{n}$: Mobility of Electrons
		- $k'_{n}=$$\mu_{n}C_{ox}$ Transconductance Parameter
		- $k_{n}=$$\mu_{n}C_{ox}\left( \frac{W}{L} \right)$ MOSFET Transconductance Parameter
	- 2 NPN Junctions with an oxide on top of the bridge between two n-type regions
		- Act as opposing diodes, preveting current flow
		- Source is typically connected to gnd
		- Drain connected to voltage
			- $V_{DS}$ is created
	- On top of the oxide is a metal plate known as the gate
	- As voltage is applied to the gate, negative carriers are drawn to the gate from within the p-type transistor
	- A bridge of negative carriers is created between the two n-type regions
		- N-Channel MOSFET
			- P-Channel MOSFET has positive carrier bridge
	- $V_{t}:$ Threshold voltage
		- $V_{GS}>V_{t}$ for any current to flow from drain to source
- ## N-MOS Operation Modes
	- $V_{OV}=V_{GS}-V_{t}$
		- Overdrive voltage
	- ![[Pasted image 20230320133241.png]]
	- Cut off Region
		- $V_{GS} < V_{t}$
	- Triode (Linear) Region $V_{DS}<V_{OV}$
		- $V_{GS} > V_{t}$
		- Current approximately increases linearly with $V_{DS}$
			- $i_{D}\approx k_{n}(V_{OV}V_{DS})$
	- Saturation Region $V_{DS}\geq V_{OV}$
		- As $V_{DS}$ increases, the resistance from drain to source increases
		- At a high enough voltage, the resistance is too high for the current to be affected by $V_{DS}$
		- The current is constant at $i_{D}=\frac{1}{2}k_{n}V^{2}_{OV}$
- ## Transconductance
	- $g_{m}=\frac{1}{r_{ds}}=\frac{2I_{d}}{V_{ov}}=k_{n}V_{ov}$ 
- ## Modulation Parameter $\Large \lambda$
	- $$V_{A}=\frac{1}{\lambda}$$
	- 
- ## PMOS Transistor
	- Opposite behavior of NMOS
	- Current flows from Source to Drain when $V_{SG}>V_{t}$
	- When negative voltage is applied to the gate,
