	- Power must be conserved, no more power out than power in
		- The power supply allows the output power to be higher than the input power

- ## Op Amp Characteristics
	- ![[Pasted image 20230118133849.png]]
		- The amplification is linear between input voltages between the power supply voltage and its negative
			- Otherwise, the output voltage can only be equal to the input power supply voltage at the positive and negative saturation levels
- ## Op Amp Assumptions
	- ### Rule 1: $\Large V_{p}=V_{n}$
	- ### Rule 2: $\Large i_{p} = i_{n}=0$
	- These rules are simplifications to make the calculations easier
		- In actuality, there are small differences in these values
	- Using these two rules, KCL can be used between the various nodes that appear in an op amp circuit to determine the behavior of the op amp
