Continues [[Semiconductor Characteristics]]
- ## P-N Junction
	- An Arsenic-doped n-type semiconductor and Boron-doped p-type semiconductor are joined together
		- The arsenic will transfer its electron to the boron
			- $As\rightarrow As^{+}$
			- $B\rightarrow B^{-}$
		- There is a difference in charge between the two semiconductors, and so there is a voltage
			- Immediately, diffusion will occur where the electrons will transfer across the junction
