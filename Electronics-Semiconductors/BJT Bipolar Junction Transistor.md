- ## BJT Anatomy
	- ### Base
		- Controls current flow through main channel
		- Equivalent to gate of MOSFET
	- ### Emitter
		- Sum of base and collector current
		- Arrow on symbol connects from base to emitter
		- On a PNP transistor, this pin is connected to +V
	- ### Collector
		- Conneted to GND on a PNP transistor
- ## Types of BJT
	- ### NPN
		- Current flows into base
		- Two outward facing diodes
			- Diode faces from P to N type
	- ### PNP
		- Two inward facing diodes

- ## Formulas
	- ### Current
		- $$I_{C}=\beta I_{B}$$
		- $$I_{E}=I_{B}(\beta+1)$$
			- Derived from KCL: $I_{E}=I_{B}+I_{C}$
		- $\beta=hfe$
			- A parameter based on transistor construction, usually given by manufacturer
			- Known as Hybrid Parameter, or current/transistor gain
	- ### Voltage
		- $$|V_{BE}|=|V_{CB}|\approx0.6-0.7$$
			- From diode constant voltage drop model, since BJTs are just two diodes
- ## Operating Regions
	- Voltage inequalities assume NPN
	- ### Cutoff: Open Switch
		- 'Off region'
		- Both Base-Emitter and Collector-Base diodes are reverse biased
		- $V_{B} < V_{E}$
			- $V_{BE}<.7V$, because the Base-Emitter diode is reverse biased
		- $V_{CE}\approx V_{cc}$
		- $I_{c}\approx 0$
	- ### Active: Linear Current Amplifier
		- Base-Emitter diode is forward biased, but the Base-Collector diode is reverse biased
		- $V_{B} > V_{E}$
			- $V_{BE} \geq .7$
		- $V_{B} < V_{C}$
			- $V_{BE} < .7$
		- 0<$V_{CE}$<$V_{cc}$
		- $0<I_{C}<I_{sat}$
		- $I_{C}=\beta I_{B}$
	- ### Saturation: Closed Switch
		- Both diodes forward biased
		- $V_{CE}=0$
		- $I_{c} \approx I_{sat}$
	- Comparing $V_{CE}$ to $V_{cc}$ can be used to determine the operating region alone
	- Comparing $I_{c}$ to $I_{sat}$ can also be used to determine operating region
		- $$I_{sat} = \frac{V_{cc}}{R_{C}+R_{E}}$$

- ## Amplifier Characteristics
	- In order to acheive amplification, transistor must be in the Active mode
	- Specifcally, the transistor should be **Midpoint Biased**
		- $V_{CE} = \frac{1}{2}V_{cc}$
		- $I_{C}=\frac{1}{2}I_{sat}$
