# CAN and Automotive Applications
- Modern cars are loaded with many microcontrollers distributed across the vehicle to control various subsystems
- CAN was developed originally to interface these microcontrollers
# Physical Interface
- All devices on the CAN bus are connected on a single 2-wire differentially signaled bus
- Only one device can transmit at once
	- Half duplex
	- Requires MAC mechanism
