# Inter Integrated Circuit Comms
- Consists of two signals SCL and SDA
	- Clock and data
	- Some slave devices may force the clock low at times to delay the master sending more data, or to require more time to prepare data before them master reads it
		- This is called clock stretching
- Half-Duplex, only one device talks at a time
- Unlike UART or SPI, I2C bus drivers are open drain. This means they can pull the line low, but not high.
	- A pullup resistor must be provided to generate high signals
	- This means there is no bus contention where one device tries to drive the line high, while another tries to drive it low
- Two types of messages: Address frame, or data frames
	- Frames are always 9 bits
	- 7 bits for the address, 1 for indicating reading or writing
		- 1 for reading
	- The 9th bit is acknowledge

- Start condition: master pulls clock and data lines low
- After the address message is sent, the slave must pull the data line low to acknowledge the message
