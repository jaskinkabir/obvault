					- Heavy industrial
				- Compount-wound for both series and shunt for high torque and control
					- elevators and hoists

					- Accurate, fast, reliable
					- Low torque at high speeds
					- Hard to control at high speeds
					- No feedback
			- ### Servo
				- Consists of a motor, feedback device, and a controller
					- Feedback is an encoder or resolver
				- PWM controls position
		- ### Hydraulics
			- Uses fluid to transfer force with pistons
		- ### Pneumatics
			- Hydraulics but with air
			- Need air filter, compressor
			- Accumulator (reservoir)
			- Actuators
			- Pressure gauges
- ## Motor Encoders and Gearing
	- Gear ratio is typically motor:wheel
		- 300:1 means 300 motor for 1 wheel rotation
			- Direction of power transmission
- ## Hardware Design
	- Batteries in series increase voltage, same capacity
	- Batteries in parallel keep votlage, increase capacity
	- Batteries should be arranged such that they discharge equally
		- ![[Pasted image 20240229154050.png]]
		- Rightmost battery has 4x the load
	- To reduce voltage:
		- Voltage divider
			- Waste energy to heat resistor
		- Voltage regulator
		- DC/DC Converter
			- Efficient
			- Costly
		- Transformer
			- Complex
			- Convert to AC then back to DC
				- Lossy
	- General vs detailed block diagram
		- Detailed will have specific pins listed
		- Every connection is explicitly stated, only 1 signal per wire
			- Each wire must be labeled

- ## RSLK Block Diagram
	- Wheel Diameter 7cm, wheelbase 14cm
	- 360 pulses per wheel rotation
	- 3 pulses per motor rotation
	- 120:1 gearing
	- Bump sensors use an internal pulldown
	- Light sensor array uses 8 analog input pins
		- Takes 3.3V and 0V
	- ## Motor Controllers
		- Take Enable, Direction, and Speed from the MCU
		- Take 5V, 0V, and 3.3V from the PSU
		- Output M+ and M- signals to the motor
		- Motors themselves output encoder signals back to the MCU
			- These encoders need 0V and 3.3V from the PSU as well
	- Ultrasonic sensor
		- Typically needs 5V level converter

- ## Analog to Digital Conversion
	- An ADC outputs a digital value n based on an input voltage using the following three parameters
		-  $N$ bits of precision,
		- $V_{+ref}$ max voltage
		- $V_{-ref}$ min voltage
	- From these parameters you can determine
		- Step size
			- $$\Delta V=\frac{V_{+ref}-V_{-ref}}{2^{N-1}}$$
		- Value of n for any given input voltage
			- $$n=\frac{V_{in}-V_{-ref}}{\Delta V}=\frac{(V_{in}-V_{-ref})(2^{N-1})}{V_{+ref}-V_{-ref}}$$
				- n must be rounded, as the ADC will choose the closest value of n (according to this class)
		- Actual Voltage for a given value of n
			- $$V_{in}=n\Delta V+V_{-ref}=\frac{n*(V_{+ref}-V_{-ref})}{2^{N-1}}+V_{-ref}$$
