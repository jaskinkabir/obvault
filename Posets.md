- # Partial Order
	- Reflexive
	- Antisymmetric
		- Asymmetric must be irreflexive
	- Transitive
- # Lattice
	- Must have a defined max and min
	- A partially ordered set $(L,R)$ where every subset $\{a,b\} \in L$ has both a meet and a join
		- **A meet**: $(a\land b)$
			- The greatest lower bound of a and b
				- $(a\land b)Ra$ if ($a\land b)Rb$
