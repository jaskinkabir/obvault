Continues [[Signal Transformation]]
- ## Signal Parity:
	- Even: $f(-x) = f(x)$
		- Symmetry after being reflected across the Y-Axis
	- Odd: $f(-x)=-f(x)$
		- Symmetry after a $180\degree$ rotation about the origin
	- Follow the same arithmetic rules of even and odd numbers
		- $O+E=O$
		- $E+E=E$
		- $O+O=E$
		- $EE=E$
		- $OE=E$
		- $OO=O$
	- Not all signals fall into either of these categories. 
	- Signals can be decomposed into even and odd components
- ## Signal Decomposition:
	- All signals can be represented as the sum of an even component and an odd component
	- $x(t)=x_{e}(t)+x_{o}(t)$
		- $x(-t)=x_{e}(t)-x_{o}(t)$
			- By definition of even and odd functions
		- Even and odd components add together to form original signal
		- $x_{e}(t)=\frac{x(t)+x(-t)}{2}$
		- $x_{o}(t)=\frac{x(t)-x(-t)}{2}$
- ## 1/13 EXP:
