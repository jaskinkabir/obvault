- The Raspberry pi platform makes development for embedded linux systems approachable for beginners
- While the overhead is significant, is there a threshold where the ease of use overcomes this overhead?
- If the processor is fast enough, and there is enough RAM available, the difficulty of debugging or upgrading optimized code may be more costly than developing on this "beginner's" platform
- PYNQ may provide a similar platform for FPGA based systems
