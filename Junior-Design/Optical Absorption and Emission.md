 - ## Beer's Law
	 - $\frac{dI(x)}{dx}=\alpha I(x)$
	 - $I_{f}=I_{0}e^{-\alpha d}$
		 - This is Beer's Law
		 - $I_{0}$ is light intensity ion the surface (photon/cm^2)
		 - $I_{f}$ is light intensity after traveling for a distance if d (photon/cm2)
		 - $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient for the material, $\frac{1}{\alpha}$ is considered the absorption depth (1/cm)
			 - A property of both the material and the wavelength of light being absorbed
	 - Semiconductors with a direct bandgap will have a higher $\alpha$
		 - Semiconductors with indirect badgap have lower due to photon involvement
