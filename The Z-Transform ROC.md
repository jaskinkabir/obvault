- ## Properties of the ROC
	- Consists of rings centered at the origin
	- ROC has no poles
	- If $x[n]$ is finite in duration, the ROC contains all Z, potential excluding only a few points
	- If ROC contains the circle $|Z|=1$, the DTFT exists
		- Because for the DTFT, $Z=e^{j\omega}$, which has 
	- ROC of right-sided signal is the outside of a ring
	- ROC of left-sided signal is the inside of a ring
	- ROC of two-sided signal is the space between two rings
	- If $X(Z)$ is rational its ROC is bounded by poles, or extends to infinity.
