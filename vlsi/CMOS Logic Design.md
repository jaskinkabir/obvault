- ## Multi-Level Logic Implementations
	- Take $F=\overline{(a+b)(c+d)}$
		- ### Naive implementation:
			- ![[Pasted image 20240124103628.png]]
			- Transistor breakdown
				- Each OR Gate requires
					- 4 transistors for NOR
					- 2 transistors for inverter
				- NAND requires 4 transistors
				- **Total of 16 transistors**
		- ### Based VLSI Implementation
			- There is a process for designing multilevel logic
				- Design NFET side first, then invert structure for PFET
				- On NFET side, any variables that are ANDed together are in series, any that are ORed are in parallel

						- This shows $AB + CD$
							- A and B are in parallel, that pairing is in series with the parallel pair of C and D
				- Then invert these rules for the PFET side and connect

					- The same logic has been achieved with just 8 transistors
