- ## CMOS Signal Strength
	- ### NMOS
		- $V_{tn}$ is how much higher the gate needs to be relative to the source for NMOS
			- $V_{G}-V_{s}\geq  V_{tn}$
		- NMOS passes weak or degraded 1s, strong 0s
			- Why?
		- ### NMOS Ladder
			- While a logic low or high has discrete values, the real voltage representing a low or high may be anywhere between these arbitrarily set ranges
				- Across some ladder, this voltage can degrade and cross over into the wrong region
			- Consider the following circuit:
				- ![[Pasted image 20240205120139.png]]
				- The voltage at $V_{S_{1}}$ must be a logic high, but it cannot be equal to$V_{dd}$ because $V_{GS} \geq V_{tn}$
					- Assume $V_{GS}=V_{tn}$
						- This is the minimum value required for NMOS to turn on and pass the logic high
					- $V_{S_{1}}=V_{G}-V_{GS}=V_{dd}-V_{tn}=V_{G_{2}}$
				- Voltage at $V_{s_{2}}=V_{G_{3}}$?
					- $V_{s_{2}}=V_{G_{2}}-V_{G_{2}S_{2}}=V_{G_{2}}-V_{tn}=V_{dd}-V_{tn}-V_{tn}$
					- $V_{S_{2}}=V_{dd}-2V_{tn}$
				- A pattern can be seen
					- $V_{G_{x}}=V_{S_{x-1}}=V_{dd}-(x-1)V_{tn}$
				- As the signal moves up the ladder, $V_{G_{x}}$ approaches 0
					- This means it could pass the threshold and become low
					- Which results in a loss of information and the circuit fails
				- What if $V_{D}=0?$
					- Then $V_{S}$ does not have to equal $V_{tn}$ if we assume that $V_{dd}>V_{tn}$
					- $V_{G}$ can remain
	- ### PMOS
		- Passes weak or degraded 0s, strong 1s
		- $|V_{tp}|$ is how much lower the gate needs to be than the source for PMOS to turn on
			- $V_{G}-V_{s}\leq V_{}{tp}$
- ### Transmission gates
	- Pass both strong 0 and 1
	- Double inverter or buffer,
