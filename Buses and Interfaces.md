- ## Interface
	- A piece of hardware that exchanges data according to a protocol
	- ## Protocol Classifications
		- ### Synchronicity:
			- Clock and data 
		- ### Responsiveness
			- Whether assertion of a coordinating signal receives a response or not
			- Two signals to perform handshaking are referred to as a responsive pair
		- ### Initiator
			- Which module initiates transfer
		- ### Control Level
			- Whether signal is coordinating transfer of a single element or a block of data
- ## Bus
	- ### Bus Signals
		- #### Control
			- Clock
			- Request and grant
			- Command (read/write)
		- #### Data
			- Data to be transferred
			- Address of data
	- ### Synchronous Bus
		- Clock is part of control signal 
			- Not the processor clock
		- Transactions take a fixed number of cycles
		- ### Protocol Example:
			- Processor pulls read request high
			- Places address on bus for 2 cycles
			- Wait for data to be read for 4 cycles
			- Data is placed on bus for 2 cycles
			- Request signal is pulled low
	- ## Asynchronous Bus
		- No clock
		- Devices use responive handshake to coordinate
			- Move on when both parties agree
		- Example
			- Place address on bus, raise readReq
				- Memroy raises Ack to indicate it has seen request and read address
			- Device sees Ack, drops readReq and Address
			- Memory drops Ack when it sees readreq dropped
			- When data reeady, memory places on bus and raises dataready
