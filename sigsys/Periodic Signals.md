- ## Definition:
	- $x(t\pm T)=x(t)$, where $T$ is the period
- ## Adding Periodic Signals
	- If $x_{2}(t)$ has a period of 2, and $x_{3}(t)$ of 3, the signal $x_{2}(t)+x_{3}(t)$ will have a period of 6, because it is the lowest common multiple
		- **IFF $\large\frac{T_{2}}{T_{3}}$ IS RATIONAL**
			- If not, the resulting function will not be periodic
- ## Sinusoids:
	- All Sinusoids are energy signals
		- Infinite integral of the square of a sinusoid is infinite
	- Power
		- $\int _{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} A^2\cos^2(\omega t+\phi) \, dt$ =  $\int _{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} A^{2}\frac{1}{2}\cos^2(2\omega t+2\phi)+\frac{1}{2} \, dt$
		- $=\frac{A^2}{2}$
			- Sum of sinusoids will have power equal to half the sum of the squares of the amplitudes
		- All sinusoids are power signals
